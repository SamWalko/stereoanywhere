## :clapper: Introduction

We introduce Stereo Anywhere, a novel stereo-matching framework that combines geometric constraints with robust priors from monocular depth Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). By elegantly coupling these complementary worlds through a dual-branch architecture, we seamlessly integrate stereo matching with learned contextual cues. Following this design, our framework introduces novel cost volume fusion mechanisms that effectively handle critical challenges such as textureless regions, occlusions, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Through our novel optical illusion dataset, MonoTrap, and extensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our synthetic-only trained model achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot generalization, significantly outperforming existing solutions while showing remarkable robustness to challenging cases such as mirrors and transparencies.

**Contributions:** 

* A novel deep stereo architecture leveraging monocular depth VFMs to achieve strong generalization capabilities and robustness to challenging conditions.

* Novel data augmentation strategies designed to enhance the robustness of our model to textureless regions and non-Lambertian surfaces.

* A challenging dataset with optical illusion, which is particularly challenging for monocular depth with VFMs.

* Extensive experiments showing Stereo Anywhere's superior generalization and robustness to conditions critical for either stereo or monocular approaches.

## :memo: Code

Details about training and testing scripts will be released soon.


## :floppy_disk: Datasets

We used [Sceneflow](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html) dataset for training and eight datasets for evaluation.

Specifically, we evaluate our proposal and competitors using:
- 5 indoor/outdoor datasets: [Middlebury 2014](https://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/scenes2014/), [Middlebury 2021](https://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/scenes2021/), [ETH3D](https://www.eth3d.net/datasets), [KITTI 2012](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_stereo_flow.php?benchmark=stereo), [KITTI 2015](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=stereo);
- two datasets **containing non-Lambertian** surfaces: [Booster](https://cvlab-unibo.github.io/booster-web/) and [LayeredFlow](https://layeredflow.cs.princeton.edu/);
- and finally with **MonoTrap** our novel stereo dataset specifically designed to challenge monocular depth estimation.

Details about datasets will be released soon.

## :train2: Training

We will provide futher information to train Stereo Anywhere soon.

## :rocket: Test

Evaluation command example:

```bash
python test.py --datapath <DATAPATH> --dataset <DATASET> \

```

We will provide futher information to test Stereo Anywhere soon.

## :art: Qualitative Results

In this section, we present illustrative examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.

**Qualitative Results -- Zero-Shot Generalization.** Predictions by state-of-the-art models and Stereo Anywhere. In particular the first row shows an extremely challenging case for SceneFlow-trained models, where Stereo Anywhere achieves accurate disparity maps thanks to VFM priors.

**Qualitative results -- Zero-Shot non-Lambertian Generalization.** Predictions by state-of-the-art models and Stereo Anywhere. Our proposal is the only stereo model correctly perceiving the mirror and transparent railing.
